To create this repo, I used three git commands. First, I used git init to set up which files I wanted to save. I then used git add to select which files in my directory I wanted to add to the repository. Lastly, I used git commit to save the snapshot of the file I created.

To upload these files to github, I used the following commands:
git remite add origin github.com/mrgonz0/Assignment7.git
git  brnach -M main
git push -u origin main

Coauthors, if you wish to clone the repo and run it on your system, use the following commands:
